# Loan Approval Prediction
Loan approval prediction leverages machine learning to analyze applicant features like credit score, income, and employment history, estimating the likelihood of approval. This approach streamlines decision-making, reduces risk, and enhances customer experience by accurately forecasting loan outcomes for financial institutions.

# Overview of project
## Introduction
Loan Approval Prediction is one of the problems that Machine Learning has solved in fintech businesses like banks and financial institutions. Loan approval prediction means using credit history data of the loan applicants and algorithms to build an intelligent system that can determine loan approvals. 

## Problem Statement
The company seeks to automate (in real time) the loan qualifying procedure based on information given by customers while filling out an online application form. It is expected that the development of ML models that can help the company predict loan approval in accelerating decision-making process for determining whether an applicant is eligible for a loan or not.
